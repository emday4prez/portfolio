      `Technology and Design have always been the primary pillars of my life. As a child I was fascinated by computers and personal electronic devices.`,
      `As a engineer, long days and nights were worked blending the line between art and technology. Always going above and beyond to please high profile clients, I quickly rose through the ranks at a top Hollywood studio, and began a successful independent freelance career.  `,
      `When I started learning JavaScript, fell in love immediately. Feeling like a kid in candy store, I began enthusiastically working on my skills with React, Node, GraphQL, and several other modern web development tools. In addition to making web sites, I love designing them too. In 2021 I completed a UX Design program offered online by Google.`,
